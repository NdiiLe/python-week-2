ANATOMY OF A FUNCTION

FUNCTIONS

	• They are composed of a name and parameters which are denoted by the def statement
	• To create a function you need to include "num1, num2 and operation" as parameters.
	• The goal is to make the function simple, taking 2 numbers and an operation (sum or multiply) as input and returns a result. If the operation is "sum" the function should return the sum of num1 and num2, and if its "multiply", the function should return the product of num1 and num2

NAMED PARAMETERS

Are known as "Keyword Arguments", they allow us to pass arguments to a function by explicitly specifying the parameter names along with their value. It provides more clarity and flexibility when calling functions, especially for functions with multiple parameters.

*args & **kwargs

They come after the positional arguments.
The order of first two arguments is important and cannot be changed, however after the mandatory arguments, the keyword argument can be in any order.

Optional arguments are useful, there's a functional limitation to how many variables can be anticipated.

We use kwargs to handle a keyword arguments. Kwargs is short for keyword argument.
Keyword arguments have keys and values and can be passed in any order.
