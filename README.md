	• They are composed of a name and parameters which are denoted by the def statement
	• To create a function you need to include "num1, num2 and operation" as parameters.
	• The goal is to make the function simple, taking 2 numbers and an operation (sum or multiply) as input and returns a result. If the operation is "sum" the function should return the sum of num1 and num2, and if its "multiply", the function should return the product of num1 and num2
